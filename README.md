# AutoCD

- A new Automated Community Detection model (AutoCD), which leverages the powerful generative capability of large language models (LLMs) to improve the GNAS method for community detection. Specifically, we design a new set of \textit{AutoCD prompts} that helps LLMs understand the community detection task and generate new GNN architectures for the task. Moreover, we define a new unsupervised evaluation function based on self-supervision learning and modularity learning to evaluate the generated GNN architectures.
